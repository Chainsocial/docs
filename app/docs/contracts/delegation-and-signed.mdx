# Delegation & Signed Ops

ChainSocial supports delegated actions and gasless signatures using EIP-712 typed data.

## DelegationSystem

- Users can delegate specific permissions to another address.
- Permissions are granular:
  - `0` post
  - `1` update profile
  - `2` send DMs
  - `3` follow/unfollow
- Delegations include a `validUntil` timestamp and are capped at **365 days**.
- Delegations can be created on-chain or registered from an EIP-712 signature.
- `isDelegateAuthorized` is used across systems to enforce on-behalf-of calls.

<Callout type="info">
  Many systems include `OnBehalfOf` variants so ephemeral wallets or relayers can act for users with explicit permission.
</Callout>
