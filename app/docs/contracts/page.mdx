# Smart Contracts

ChainSocial smart contracts are designed as modular building blocks for identity, content, and social interactions. The protocol uses a MUD World + Systems + Tables architecture so data is cleanly separated from logic and every feature can evolve independently.

<Callout type="info">
  Vision: Ship social experiences that are portable, composable, and developer-first. The contracts provide reliable primitives for identity, content, and relationships while leaving room for product creativity on top.
</Callout>

## Architecture at a Glance

- **World + namespace**: Systems are registered under the `chainsocial` namespace and invoked via the World interface.
- **Systems**: Stateless logic modules that mutate tables and emit events.
- **Tables**: Typed on-chain storage for profiles, posts, follows, notifications, and more.
- **Cross-system calls**: Systems call each other through `IWorld` to preserve `_msgSender()`.
