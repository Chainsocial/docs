# Relayer & Gasless

Relayer systems enable gasless UX by letting users prepay fees into a vault. Relayers submit signed operations and charge a fee based on gas used.

## RelayerVaultCore

- Users deposit ETH into a relayer balance.
- Withdrawals are protected by a reentrancy guard stored in a MUD table.
- Balances live in `RelayerBalance` and ETH is held by the World contract.

## RelayerFeeConfigSystem

- Namespace owner controls min/max fee bounds and a fixed gas price.
- Fixed gas price prevents fee inflation by relayers.

## Relayer Executors

- **RelayerContentExecutor**: posts, replies, quotes, reactions, edits, deletes.
- **RelayerMessagingExecutor**: direct messages.
- **RelayerSocialExecutor**: follow/unfollow and block/unblock.
- **RelayerDelegationExecutor**: delegation create/revoke and profile updates.

Each executor:
- Verifies an EIP-712 signature (supports EOA + EIP-1271 smart wallets).
- Enforces a signed `maxFee` against on-chain fee bounds.
- Computes actual fee using fixed gas price and charges from the user’s relayer balance.
