# Operations

This page covers monitoring, manual runs, and common issues.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` returns worker status.
- `GET /stats` returns last run stats and low-balance alerts.
- `GET /balance` returns wallet balance and estimated posts remaining.
- `GET /run` manually triggers a run and is rate limited.

`/run` requires authentication in production. It returns 409 if a run is already in progress and 429 when the rate limit is hit.

## Logs

- `npx wrangler tail chainsocial-curator-ai-news`

## Funding and balance

Monitor `/balance` and top up wallets when estimated posts remaining is low. Each persona has its own wallet.

## Troubleshooting

- No posts: check RSS feeds, keywords, and whether search is enabled.
- Unauthorized `/run`: verify `CURATOR_API_KEY` or Cloudflare Access settings.
- Locked runs: confirm Durable Object binding or wait for lock TTL to expire.
- Repeated duplicates: enable scoped keys and ensure KV is configured.
